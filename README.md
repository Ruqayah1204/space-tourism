## Overview

This project is a multi-page responsive website for a fictional space tourism company. It provides users with information about destinations, crew members, and available technology.

The project was inspired by a real world challeng where developers are tasked with building a production-grade frontend that follows modern UI?UX practices, uses scalable folder structures, and maintain accessibility.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

Built with

 React (with TypeScript) ‚Äì .

‚ö° Vite ‚Äì fast build tool for development and production.

üé® Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS Variables ‚Äì for styling and utility classes.

üé≠ ShadCN/UI Tabs & Buttons ‚Äì for accessible, reusable UI components.

üåê React Router DOM v6+ ‚Äì .

üñº Responsive Design ‚Äì mobile-first with fluid layouts and flexible grids.

- **‚öõÔ∏èReact + TypeScript** - component-based architecture for scalability
- **Vite** - fast build tool for development and production
- **Tailwind CSS + Custom CSS Variable** - for utility-first responsive styling
- **ShadCN UI** - for accessible, reusable UI components
- **React Router DOM** - for routing

### What I learned

During this project, I gained deeper experience in:
- Creating scalable folder structures for React projects.
- Implementing tab-based navigation where the UI updates dynamically (e.g., image + content switching).
- Handling state lifting (sharing active tab state between parent and child components).
- Building smooth mobile navigation menus with custom CSS animations.
- Changing the background image for each route and screen dynamically


```tsx
  const location = useLocation();

    let backgroundImg = "";

    if (location.pathname === "/") {
        backgroundImg ="bg-home-mobile md:bg-home-tablet lg:bg-home-desktop";
    } else if (location.pathname === "/destination") {
        backgroundImg = "bg-destination-mobile md:bg-destination-tablet lg:bg-destination-desktop";
    } else if (location.pathname === "/crew") {
        backgroundImg = "bg-crew-mobile md:bg-crew-tablet lg:bg-crew-desktop";
    } else if (location.pathname === "/technology") {
        backgroundImg = "bg-technology-mobile md:bg-technology-tablet lg:bg-technology-desktop";
    }

    return (
        <div className={`... ${backgroundImg}`}>

          // code here

        </div>
    )
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to improve this project by:

+ Adding page transition animations with Framer Motion.
- Implementing dark/light theme toggle.
+ Enhancing accessibility (keyboard navigation for tabs and menus).
- Optimizing for performance (image lazy loading, caching).
+ Expanding the app to support internationalization (i18n) for multiple language
